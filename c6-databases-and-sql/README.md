Sequential Query Language(SQL) is used for writing queries for a relational database to retrieve information from it.

Data : Collection of information in the form of words, numbers, pictures etc.

Database : Repository of data. Provides functionalities such as adding, deleting, and quering data.

Databases are classified based on the way they store data.

1. Relational database: Stores data in tabular form

   Ex: MySQL, Oracle Database, IBM Db2, etc.
